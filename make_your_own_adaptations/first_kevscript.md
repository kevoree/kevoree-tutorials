# First KevScript

First of all, here is a pointer to the [documentation of KevScript](http://kevoree.org/doc/#kevoree-script-aka-kevscript). It describes the commands, how to use them and gives examples.

[KevScript Doc](http://kevoree.org/doc/#kevoree-script-aka-kevscript)

First let see what a complete KevScript looks like.
Open a Kevoree Editor and do again the Chat application (see [Level 0](http://kevoree.org/practices/level0/)).
Once your model is ready (no need to push to the platform), click on the **KevScript** icon of the editor. It should open a panel at the bottom of the frame. Here, click on
`Load Current Model`
You should see, in the bottom panel, the KevScript to execute in order to create the model you see. As a proof, clear the model (`Model / Clear`), and click on *Execute* in the bottom panel. You should see you model disapear and apear again.

Now, from this model I want you to add a *Ticker* component and connect it to the existing channels.
Copy/paste the script in a text editor to keep it safe.
Clear the script (not the model).
Create the script to add an instance of *Ticker* and connect it to a channel.
Test your script by executing.
Sould you fail, clear the model, copy/paste the previous script and execute it to get back the base model.
