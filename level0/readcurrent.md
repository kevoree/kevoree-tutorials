# Read the current model

To create the chat application we will use two instances of an existing component. To be able to create an instance, we first need to complete the library of available components. To do so in the Editor,    
`Model / Load Kevoree Library / JAVA / ORG.KEVOREE.{replace by libname}`    
And select the *Channels* and *Toys*. The library of available components, on the left, should fill up with additional components from these libraries.
