# Do It Yourself

Now, you have in hands all you need to make your own components.
You know how to prepare your Maven project, you have examples of components, with input and output ports, and examples of calls with and without callbacks. By the way, you also have examples of how to create a frame, with a button, or a popup window.

I now want you to create two components. You can do it in the same project (tooooo easy) or create a new project from scratch (yeah !... you can still get inspired by the sample project).
On one side, I want a component that has a integer parameter called *num*. This component also displays a frame with a single button. On cllick this frame sends the value of *num* throug an output port, and waits for an answer to know if this number is positive or negative.
On the other side, another component that answers *true* if the number is strictly positive, false otherwise. You can add a frame for that if you want.
