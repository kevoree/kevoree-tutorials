#KevScript and Runtime Adaptations

In this practice, you will learn how to use Kevoree Script (a.k.a. KevScript) to edit your models at both design time and run time.     
You will also see how to launch a Kevoree runtime with a specific configuration (bootstrap) and how KevScript can be used to program self-adaptations in software systems.

For this tutorial, you only need to have the ProducerConsumer Sample project. All other components used will be collected from the *Toy* library.    
Obviously, you'll need a Kevoree Runtime, a Kevoree Editor, an IDE and Maven installed.
