# Reactive self-healing systems

A reactive system is caracterized by self dynamic adaptations triggered by internal or external events. In other words, it means that the adaptation strategy must be embedded into one (or more) of your components deployed in the system.    
The overall goal of this practice is to create an elastic manager for Web servers. Along this practice, you will learn to write your own elastic system by mean of simple model editions. Skills on Kevoree Script (a.k.a. KevScript) are required and this [documentation](http://kevoree.org/doc) should help you.    
In addition you should have a working compilation toolchain as described in the *level1*.
