# Setting up your environment
First of all, you need to have a `JRE 1.6` at least.    
Make sure you have a running installation of [Apache Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed. Check it out by opening a console and typing `mvn -version`. Otherwise follow the Apache instructions. 

For the Java development, we would suggest using [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html), because Maven is well integrated.       
Then browse to the [Kevoree Samples Repository](https://github.com/kevoree/kevoree-samples/releases "Title") and download the last stable version of the Project Sample. Unzip the file in a convenient place (avoid spaces in the path).
